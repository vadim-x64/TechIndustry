# TechIndustry

TechIndustry is a scalable, production-ready web platform for IT education, skill development, and automated knowledge assessment. The project is designed with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance, and real-world learning workflows.

---

## Overview

TechIndustry provides a modern Learning Management System (LMS) that enables users to study structured IT courses, track progress in real time, and receive certificates upon course completion. The platform supports both authenticated users and guests, ensuring an accessible entry point while preserving full functionality for registered learners.

---

## Technologies

The platform is built using a robust and maintainable technology stack:

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Azure Database for PostgreSQL)
* **ORM:** Sequelize
* **Architecture:** Layered MVC (Routes, Controllers, Services, Models)
* **Templating:** Handlebars (HBS)
* **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication + Google OAuth 2.0
* **Email Service:** Nodemailer-based SMTP integration for account verification and transactional emails
* **SEO:** Dynamic meta tags, Open Graph support, canonical URLs, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
* **Cloud & Deployment:** Microsoft Azure App Service, custom domain configuration  
* **Security:** Helmet (CSP, HSTS), CSRF protection, Rate limiting, Input sanitization
* **Performance:** Compression (gzip), static asset caching, SSR-friendly rendering
* **UI/UX:** Custom CSS (Glassmorphism), responsive layout, modern typography
* **Environment Configuration:** Secure `.env` configuration

## Performance & Security

- **Compression enabled** for responses (gzip)  
- **Static caching** for `public/` and `assets/` with long-lived cache headers  
- **Helmet with CSP + HSTS** for safer SSR pages and CDN assets  
- **Global rate limiter** to protect endpoints
- **CSRF protection** enabled (csrf token exposed to templates)
- **Mongo sanitize** middleware for payload safety (works as extra hardening)

## Core Features

### Learning Management System (LMS)

* Modular course structure (Courses → Modules → Lessons)
* Interactive lesson content with rich text and code examples
* Course categorization (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, Data Science)
* Fully responsive interface for desktop and mobile devices

### User Progress Tracking

* Automatic lesson completion tracking
* Persistent progress storage in PostgreSQL
* Real-time progress visualization (percentages, progress bars)
* Course status states: not started, in progress, completed

### Automated Assessment

* Module-based quizzes
* Instant validation of answers
* Detailed feedback for incorrect responses
* Progress analytics and learning insights

### Gamification & Economy

* XP rewards for lessons/quizzes and course completion
* Coins economy (earn + spend), balance tracking
* Levels and badges system (progress-based achievements)
* Leaderboard with top users and stats

### Profile Customization (Shop / Inventory)

* In-app Shop with categories and purchasable items
* Inventory page to manage owned cosmetics and upgrades
* Equip / unequip mechanics for profile customization:
  * Avatar frames
  * Title badges
  * Profile themes
* Purchase history / transaction history support

### Code Sandbox

* Built-in Sandbox page for experimenting with code and ideas
* Designed for quick practice without leaving the platform

### Certification System

* Automatic course completion verification
* Secure PDF certificate generation
* Certificate availability checks via API
* Inline certificate preview and download

### Authentication & Access Control

* JWT-based user authentication
* Secure protected routes
* Guest access with limited functionality
* Automatic token validation and expiration handling

---

## Frontend Behavior

* Guests can browse public content (courses, roadmaps, leaderboard, info pages).
* Authenticated users unlock progress tracking, quizzes, certificates, shop, and profile customization.
* Restricted actions (quizzes, certificates, shop, profile features) require login and automatically redirect guests.
* UI dynamically changes based on authentication state (navigation, progress indicators, gamification stats, customization features).
* Private user pages (profile, settings, quizzes, certificates, shop, inventory) are excluded from search indexing.
* Public pages are optimized for SEO and performance using SSR, dynamic meta tags, canonical URLs, lazy loading, and optimized font loading.


---

## Repository Structure

* **main** – Project documentation, configuration, and metadata
* **dev** – Active development branch
* **feature/** – Feature-specific branches (authentication, quizzes, certificates, etc.)
* **fix/** – Hotfix branches for critical issues
* **refactor/** – Code refactoring, performance improvements, and internal optimizations without changing functionality
